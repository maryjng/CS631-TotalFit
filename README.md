1.  ER diagram lines up with the mapping

 

There doesn't appear to be any direct contradictions between the ER diagram, and mapping details. The diagram describes objects, attributes, and relationships within the system, while the mapping details provide further clarification on the tables and their columns in the database. It seems that the information is consistent and complementary, providing a comprehensive view of the business process.

 

2. Memberships types

 

We have a dropdown menu with four membership types to choose from.

 

1. Basic Membership

2. VIP Membership

3. Student Membership

4. Family Membership
